                        GuardianLink is a mission-driven platform connecting skilled cybersecurity volunteers with
                        non-profit organizations in need of protection and digital support. We believe digital safety is a public good.

                    <p>
                        We provide a streamlined web application for cybersecurity professionals to register, and for non-profits to
                        request assistance. Our admin team facilitates secure matches between verified volunteers and trusted organizations.

                    <p>
                        Non-profits often lack the budget and resources to protect themselves from cyber threats. We believe that by
                        contributing our skills where they matter most, we strengthen communities and defend what matters.
